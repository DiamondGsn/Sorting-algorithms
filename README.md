1)# Sorting Algorithms Comparison Project

## Overview
This Go program demonstrates and compares the performance of five fundamental sorting algorithms when applied to matrices. The project focuses on analyzing algorithm efficiency by tracking comparisons and swaps during sorting.

## Features
- **Implemented Algorithms**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Shell Sort
  - Quick Sort

- **Matrix Operations**:
  - Random matrix generation
  - Column-wise sorting
  - Absolute value comparison

- **Performance Analysis**:
  - Tracks comparisons and swaps
  - Displays formatted comparison table

## Requirements
- Go 1.16+
- Basic terminal/command prompt

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-algorithms.git
cd sorting-algorithms
```
2)Build and run:
```
go run main.go
```

3)Follow prompts to:
Enter matrix dimensions (rows and columns)
View original random matrix
See each sorting algorithm's results
Examine the performance comparison table

Key Observations
Quick Sort generally shows best performance
Bubble Sort has highest swap count
Shell Sort offers good balance for medium datasets
Absolute value comparison affects sort order
